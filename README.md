# NPM Visual

This tool creates a visual graph of popular NPM packages. Data is scraped from various package.json files. We then analyize them to identify interesting package relationships. 

One goal is to identify packages that are not well maintained, but are heavily relied on by massive companies. It would also be nice to find packages that are heavily relied on that have unusual liscences.


# ToDo
Add additional notes here. We should use Github tasks.

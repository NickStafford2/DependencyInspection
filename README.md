# Dependency Inspection
<a href="www.dependencyinspection.com">www.dependencyinspection.com</a>

A simple tool that inspects your project's dependencies, and identifies vulnerabilities and risks that could arise from them.  Creates a 3D force graph of popular NPM packages for easy inspection. Data is scraped from various sources such as the npm registry, OBV.com, and ClearlyDefined.

The goal is to identify packages that are not well maintained, but are heavily relied on by massive companies. It would also be nice to find packages that are heavily relied on that have unusual licences. Rugpull threat assessment is undergoing active development.

# Still in Development
I still have a ton of work to do. I will be adding more data sources over the coming weeks, and showing their assessments on the frontend.
